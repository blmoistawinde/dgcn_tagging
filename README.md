# Enriching Ontology with Temporal Commonsense for Low-Resource Audio Tagging

This repository contains the code and data for the CIKM 2021 paper ["Enriching Ontology with Temporal Commonsense for Low-Resource Audio Tagging"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01009)

- audioset: experiment code for the audioset dataset
- sonyc: experiment code for the sonyc dataset (DCASE 2019 Task 5)
- raw_data: raw KG data and processing codes 
    - establish links between ASER commonsense and ontologies 
    - produce the enriched graphs (results already in the above directories)
